#  Week 9 – Word Frequency Counter 

##  How to Compile and Run

### **1. Compile the program**

```
javac Iterators.java
javac Streams.java 
```

### **2. Run the program with an input file**

```
java Iterators pride-and-prejudice.txt
java Streams pride-and-prejudice.txt
```

This project implements a simple **word frequency analyzer** in Java.
Given a text file, it reads the content, removes common stop-words, counts occurrences of remaining words, and prints the **top 25 most frequent words**.

It uses:

* Java Streams
* Functional programming
* Set/Map collections
* Command-line file input
